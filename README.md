# US Accidents Severity Prediction

Traffic accidents pose a significant public health issue, with severe implications for safety and economic impact. This project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to predict accident severity using a comprehensive dataset of US accidents from 2016 to 2023, encompassing 7.7 million unique accident records across 49 states and featuring 46 rich attributes. The primary goal is to develop robust, high-accuracy classification models to predict accident severity, characterized by a severity score ranging from 1 (least impact) to 4 (most significant impact). This supervised classification task will employ various machine learning models, including logistic regression, support vector machine, random forest, gradient boosted decision tree, and multi-layer perceptron. The project will address several critical aspects: handling massive datasets, conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA), uncovering meaningful patterns within the data, and rigorously evaluating the performance of the classification models. The outcomes are expected to provide valuable insights into accident causation and contribute to the development of predictive tools for reducing accidents, optimizing traffic flow, and enhancing ETA prediction systems.
